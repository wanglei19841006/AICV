## Data Mining Class Assignment 2
## KNN Algorithm implementation in Python

### Overview
The k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm is one of the most fundamental and powerful Algorithm to understand, implement and use in classification problems when there is no or little knowledge about the distribution of data.

### Requirements to compile this code
* Python *3.0*
* Pandas
* Numpy

### Testing and Training data
All testing and training data is under ./data directory.

*testing.csv* file has been created and all Direction column values have been calculated, so we will be able to calculate the accuracy of KNN each time.

### Build and Run
Simply run:
```
python main.py
```
